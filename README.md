### Hi there 👋 My name is Tallie :)

- 🔭 I recently finished ... an internship with Google, where I developed an open-source web application to help process the data from a user's Google Cloud project's Dataflow jobs and allow the user to quickly see a high-level overview of their project's pipelines.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... about robotics and computer vision.
- 📫 How to reach me: come and say hi on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tallie-blanshard-7b744b132/)!
- ⚡ Fun fact: Martin Clunes once narrated a [short story](https://www.captureonestory.com/#/story/CAe3ea9e266eaf3c56d0c6b166e71385cd) I wrote.
- ❤ I am really passionate about open-source software and for the last few years have been taking part in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) - each year slowly contributing more towards open-source software as I learn more and develop my coding skills.
- 📚 I have a particular interest in Capture the Flag type challenges (web exploitation, reverse-engineering etc.) so if anyone has any tips or suggestions on how to improve, I'd love to hear them!
